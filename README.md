# COVID-19 and Domestic Air Travel
6.268 Final Project: Sara Nicholas &amp; Lindsey Blanks

The purpose of this paper is to identify possible causes for the heterogeneity in the spread of the pandemic. Specifically, in our study we attempt to address the question: How much of the variation in early spread of the coronavirus can be explained by airline travelers from Italy? How much can be explained by airline travelers along domestic routes?  We construct a series of models that examine the relationship between air travel and number of COVID-19 cases within US states and then run log-linear regressions to examine the results.
